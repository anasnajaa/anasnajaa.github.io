The ability to have constant core values that stand against change is not easy. Holding on these constants renders you undefined with time. As the world moves on and forgets itself and as the narrative is lost to time, you risk being a driftwood in an ocean of unknown.

With this virtual self, you are nothing but a reflection of others. Identity that emerges out of need to fulfil a fleeting purpose. An echo of former self that now observes the reality unfold without reacting. In this state, the undefined becomes the norm and the reflection is what remains.

You become what is needed at that moment. No past to hold you and no future to look up to. The undefined takes over and dictates a new purpose for each encounter. The undefined breaks you out of the time loop. As an observer floating in a deafening void, you watch events unfold without participation or evolvement. When balance is lost, you are once again called into action.

You might have hopes for certain conclusions, but the balance must remain. Forget hope and stop chasing certain conclusions because in doing so you assume that there is an ending that is better or worse than the other. The fact is, there is just an ending and a lesson to be learned.

The undefined dictates that nothing is broken. Nothing needs fixing. Nothing is out of place. There is no good and there is no evil. There is a state that is always trying seek balance. Everything is where it needs to be. Don't swim against the flow, and don;t swim with it, just drift.

By being undefined, you forgo the self. The flow dictates your purpose and nudges you into action. Outside circumstances and encounters are brought in focus and become more meaningful. Nothing is a coincidence in this state. All that is required of you is to observe, listen, reflect, focus on your inner state and pay attention to the outer flow. Sharpen the tool that you've become and make use of the remaining time given to you.

You will not need to rise to the occasion, the occasion will present itself to you. Fulfil the objective and let go. As an undefined, you belong no where, attached to no one, hope for nothing, fear nothing, have no enemies and no friends. Accept the fact that you cannot change things for the better or the worse, this is the ultimate truth. Nothing can made better or improved. Try to to improve something and the scale will shift to counter balance the improvement, wether you realize it or not. With everything new gained, something else is lost in its place.

As an undefined, your role is to make sure this balance is maintained. There will be no one to support you or believe in what you believe in. There will only be people with defined desires and goals. You reflect those desires back into them, become the teacher and the lesson, conclude the events and become a story.

Accept the state of affairs, focus on inner self, become a teacher and a lesson for others, fulfil the fleeting purpose assigned to you and move on.
