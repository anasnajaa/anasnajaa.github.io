This is a post about the daily struggle of someone trying to hold on to his values no matter what.

> Fear nothing but fear itself  
> Live on nothing but hope itself  
> Cry for nothing but loosing yourself  
> Enjoy nothing but improving yourself  
> Hate nothing but destroying yourself

I curse my heart for its unending desires.

Iâ€™m a solider, waking up everyday to fight a war. A war that unfolds inside of me where the two sides are parts of me. A war of me going against my heart desires.

Some days I win the battle, and live to fight another day. Other days, I survive barely and acquire new wounds that I carry with me as a reminder of the consequences of losing to my desires.

Eventually, this war will end one day. Either my heart stops beating, or I fall into the abyss of desires. A vicious cycle of guilt and pleasure that drives the toughest of men insane. Until that day comes, I curse my heart desires.

## How to hold on

-   Never stay up late / Wake up as early as possible
-   Take cold showers
-   Fasting
-   Sports
-   Prayer and Dua'a
-   Listening and Reciting Quran
-   Reduce and avoid sins
-   Donate to charity
